# Library

A personal library app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add books, mark them as read/unread, and remove them from their collection. 

This project is part of [The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) and focuses on practicing objects and constructors.
